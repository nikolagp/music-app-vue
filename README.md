This is music app where user can register as listeners or artists and can upload or listen to their favourite songs. Specifically this one is created for a music production called "Hauz". Using Vue and Pinia, I've created a smooth and responsive user experience that allows you to browse and play music with ease. Router helps us navigate between different pages and sections of the app, and Firebase powers our real-time data storage and management. This is also Progressive Web App created with Workbox pwa plugin for Vite. I enjoyed building it!

# What I have learned

While I was building Music App Platform I have learned the fundamentals of Vue and TailwindCSS. I learned what is Pinia and store management, how to navigate between pages with navigation guards, access to the different pages depending on user registration and what works best for my current application. It was my first project using Firebase and I have learned a lot about Storage, Firestore database and Authentication.

# What issues have I faced and how I resolved them

Most challenging part was using the Firebase and some different libraries that I wasn't aware of before. After some Googling I found out the MDN documentation about them and with help of the course tutorials - it worked!
